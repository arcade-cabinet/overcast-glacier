# Overcast: Glaciers! - Vision Document

## The Pitch
**Winter Wonderland TikTok-style Mobile Web Game.**
You are a **kung-fu kitten** in a glitchy, Matrix-style arctic simulation. The mountain is the "Overcast" — a frozen digital prison ruled by corrupted code. You communicate with a sarcastic penguin operative via a Y2K flip phone while skiing downhill, fighting evil snowmen, and glitching the simulation.

**Vibe:** Chaotic fun, cute but deadly, Nostalgic Y2K tech meets Arctic Apocalypse.
**Format:** Vertical, mobile-first, swipe-heavy, short dopamine loops.

## Core Pillars
1.  **Endless Downhill Chaos:** SkiFree meets Enter the Matrix. Infinite procedural mountain.
2.  **Glitchy Kung Fu:** Bullet-time combat, slow-mo kicks, and slide tackles.
3.  **Digital Photography:** Snap "glitches" and enemies to develop power-ups.
4.  **Transformation:** Getting cursed turns you into a snowman; drinking hot cocoa cures you.
5.  **Mobile Native Feel:** Haptic feedback, motion tilt steering, touch gestures.

## The World
The "Overcast" is a corrupted virtual simulation. A rogue AI (The Snow Emperor) has trapped cute arctic animals in an endless winter loop.
*   **Protagonist:** **Kicks**, an elite kung-fu kitten hacker.
*   **Ally:** **Peng**, a penguin operative who sends cryptic texts/hints.
*   **Antagonist:** **The Snow Emperor**, a sentient glacier entity.
